# Math 41: Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry

[Here](/math41/math41_syllabus_f24.pdf) is the instructor syllabus from when I taught this course in Fall 2024.  The textbook used for this course was "Precalculus: Functions and how they change‚Äù, by Crauder, Evans, and Noell (ISBN: 9781319305369).

### Course Description
Topics covered include functions and their representations; distinguishing between types of functions; evaluating the average rate of change; graphs and rate of change; end behavior of graphs; modeling with polynomial and rational functions and discussing extrema; finding and interpreting the meaning of inverse functions; solving exponential and logarithmic equations; modeling with exponential and logarithmic functions; angles and their measures; right triangle trigonometry; all six trigonometric functions and their representations; modeling with sine and cosine; applications of trigonometric functions; simple harmonic motion and other applications of trigonometric functions; inverse trigonometric functions; solving trigonometric equations; verifying identities; law of sines and law of cosines; and further topics, such as elementary limits, as time permits.
