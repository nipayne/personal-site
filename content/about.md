## About Me
{{< figure class="aboutimag"  src="/profile2.jpg" alt="aboutimag">}}

Thank you for checking out this page.  A little about me - I am currently a second year PhD student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.  Previously, I completed my BS in Mathematics and my MS in Applied Mathematics at Northeastern University.

After I finish my degree, my hope is to remain in academia - I would love to be a math professor at a small college in the middle of nowhere that emphasizes undergraduate research.  While I don't know if that is where I'll end up, I will do everything I can to head in that direction.




## Projects
<ul>
<li>
In the spring of 2020, I completed a capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4025">MATH 4025</a>) where I worked with two other students to explore traffic impacts by the proposed MBTA GLX Green Line extension into Medford, MA.  We developed a metric we called <i>traffic score</i>, which represented the traffic congestion in a given road intersection at a given time.  To do this, we used the MBTA Developer API to capture GPS locations of commuter buses every second over the span of three weeks.  Once we obtained the relevant data, a variety of statistical tests were run.  Our paper is available upon request.
</li>
<li>
In the summer of 2021, I participated in the Northeastern <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rtg-northeastern/undergraduate/independent-research-experience?authuser=0">Summer Math Research Program</a>, learning about geometric configurations.  I co-wrote an expository <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13565">paper</a> that examines relations to symmetry groups and some interesting patterns. It also highlights a script I wrote to help better visualize various historical generation algorithms.  
</li>
<li>
In the spring of 2022, I completed yet another capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202310&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4020">MATH 4020</a>) where I explored minimal surfaces, focusing on area minimization.  This was an independent project, advised by Professor Xuwen Zhu, and concluded with a final <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPpttYQueK7-yuwLujigMNhiOTQj2f2G/view?usp=sharing">paper</a> and presentation open to students and faculty. 
</li>
<li>
In the summer/fall of 2022, I co-authored a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11837">paper</a> with Mrudul Thatte about the dimension of cycles on the unit circle.  I presented our results at JMM 2023 in Boston, MA, both during a contributed paper talk and a poster session.  The slides from the talk can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KTa3WydgTJuc2SYmSS51TpKoXqhqD52l/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

## Penn State Involvement
<ul>
<li> Treasurer of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association
</li>
<li> Co-Chair of the Graduate Student Subcommittee and Math Graduate Student Representative, Eberly College of Science Climate and Diversity Committee
</li> 
<li> At-Large Delegate and member of the Advocacy and Diversity Committee, Graduate and Professional Students Association
</li>
</ul>


## Northeastern University Math Department Involvement
I was very involved in the Northeastern University math community - so much so that the discussion warrants its own <a href = "/posts/9-9-24.md">page</a>.




## Community Involvement
<ul>
<li>
I was an academic volunteer at <a href="https://squashbusters.org/">SquashBusters</a> from 2017 to 2022, assisting middle and high school students with homework and projects.  I also helped as needed preparing juniors and seniors for the SATs and for college applications.
</li>
<li>
I was a mentor for <a href="https://sites.google.com/nhsau57.org/salemrobotics">FRC 6324</a>, a high school robotics team from Salem, NH, until early 2020.  A proud alumnus, I took the skills I developed as the 2016-17 season student coach to mentor the electrical sub-teams and assist with strategy development.
</li>
</ul>

## Other fun facts
<ul>
<li>
I play the tenor saxophone, and have since junior high school.  In high school, I participated in marching band, jazz ensemble & concert band.  In college, I played in the Northeastern Pep Band (until 2022) & Concert Band (until 2019).
</li>
<li>
I played chess competitively until I realized I didn't have patience for many-hour games (around the end of junior high).  I switched to teaching chess, and started an after-school chess program for elementary school students while I was in high school.  By the time I graduated, I had taught over 400 students, having run programs at five local schools and coordinated several other volunteers.

<li>
I have a dog <a href="/photos/20220705_204221.jpg">Quincy</a>, and a bunch of <a href="/photos/20220730_156221_2.png">chickens</a>.
