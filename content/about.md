## About Me
{{< figure class="aboutimag"  src="/profile2.jpg" alt="aboutimag">}}

Thank you for checking out this page.  A little about me -  I finished my BS in Mathematics in 2022 and my MS in Applied Math in 2023, both at Northeastern University.  Now, I am completing my first year as a PhD student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University, where my primary research interests are in PDEs, specifically conservation laws.  

After I finish my degree, my hope is to remain in academia - I would love to be a math professor at a small college in the middle of nowhere that emphasizes undergraduate research.  While I don't know if that is where I'll end up, I will do everything I can to head in that direction.




## Projects
<ul>
<li>
In the spring of 2020, I completed a capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4025">MATH 4025</a>) where I worked with two other students to explore traffic impacts by the proposed MBTA GLX Green Line extension into Medford, MA.  We developed a metric we called <i>traffic score</i>, which represented the traffic congestion in a given road intersection at a given time.  To do this, we used the MBTA Developer API to capture GPS locations of commuter buses every second over the span of three weeks.  Once we obtained the relevant data, a variety of statistical tests were run.  Our paper is available upon request.
</li>
<li>
In the summer of 2021, I participated in the Northeastern <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rtg-northeastern/undergraduate/independent-research-experience?authuser=0">Summer Math Research Program</a>, learning about geometric configurations.  I co-wrote an expository <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13565">paper</a> that examines relations to symmetry groups and some interesting patterns. It also highlights a script I wrote to help better visualize various historical generation algorithms.  
</li>
<li>
In the spring of 2022, I completed yet another capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202310&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4020">MATH 4020</a>) where I explored minimal surfaces, focusing on area minimization.  This was an independent project, advised by Professor Xuwen Zhu, and concluded with a final <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPpttYQueK7-yuwLujigMNhiOTQj2f2G/view?usp=sharing">paper</a> and presentation open to students and faculty. 
</li>
<li>
In the summer/fall of 2022, I co-authored a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11837">paper</a> with Mrudul Thatte about the dimension of cycles on the unit circle.  I presented our results at JMM 2023 in Boston, MA, both during a contributed paper talk and a poster session.  The slides from the talk can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KTa3WydgTJuc2SYmSS51TpKoXqhqD52l/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

## Penn State Involvement
<ul>
<li> Secretary of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association
</li>
<li> Co-Chair of the Graduate Student Subcommittee and Math Graduate Student Representative, Eberly College of Science Climate and Diversity Committee
</li> 
<li> At-Large Delegate and member of the Advocacy and Diversity Committee, Graduate and Professional Students Association
</li>
</ul>


## Northeastern University Math Department Involvement
<ul>
<li>
I was the 2021-22 Northeastern <a href = "https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/math-club">Math Club </a> president, overseeing the transition of the club back to in-person gatherings and the push to increase accessibility for and attendance of underclassmen students.  With the help of my executive board, we hosted a variety of speakers and panels, and trips to events at Brown University and the Museum of Science.  Meetings averaged 20-30 attendees per talk, with some attracting upwards of 50, which was an increase of over 25% from years past.  With the help of the addition of two officers, we increased our social media involvement, engaging incoming freshmen and current students on Twitter and Instagram, and grew our Discord server to over 300 members.  We also greatly improved our collaboration efforts with other Math Department organizations, including the Diversity & Inclusion Committee, MathEMA, and the Association of Women in Mathematics.  <br><br>

Following a successful campaign to bring much needed improvements to the club constitution, I stepped down as president after my undergraduate careeer came to a close.  However, I continue to be an advocate for the Math Club, and was a de facto student advisor for the new officers for the 2022-23 academic year.  For work done with the Math Club, I received the Alberto Galmarino Award in May 2022, an award given to up to one undergraduate math student each year in recognition of service to the department.</li>
<li>
I was the interim vice-president of <a href="https://www.northeasternmathema.org/">MathEMA</a>, the department's student mentoring program, in the fall of 2022.  During this time, I developed trainings for incoming mentors.  I also assisted in getting the program recognized as an official Northeastern student organization, which affords MathEMA the opportunity for university and external funding.  As part of this process, I helped develop an undergraduate student board, and advised this group in the spring of 2023.
</li>
<li>
In the spring of 2023, I worked with two current PhD students to develop the department's <a href = "https://mathdept.sites.northeastern.edu/directed-reading-program/">Directed Reading Program</a>.  We paired interested undergraduate students with math PhD students, and these pairings explored a topic of their choosing through self-paced reading of a particular book or article with substantial guidance of the graduate student mentor.  For the inaguaral semester, we had approximately 30 undergraduate students and 10 PhD students participate.  The DRP will continue next year under the guidance of an organizing committee, with funding providing by the department.  For this work (and work done with the other student organizations), I received the Outstanding Departmental Service Graduate Award in April 2023.
</li>
<li>
I was a member of the department's Diversity & Inclusion Committee, where I was originally representing the Math Club but this year, students in the master's program.  This committee consists of faculty and students and meets regularly throughout the year (including summers) to discuss, among other topics, how to increase student engagement with department events and organizations, as well as how to better communicate with students as a whole.  
</li>
<li>
During my time as an undergraduate student, I also was a peer tutor, a teaching assistant for an introduction to proofs course for math and CS majors (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=1365">MATH 1365</a>), and a grader for courses such as Calculus 3 (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=2321">MATH 2321</a>), Linear Algebra (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=2331">MATH 2331</a>), and Complex Variables (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4555">MATH 4555</a>).
</li>
</ul>



## Community Involvement
<ul>
<li>
I was an academic volunteer at <a href="https://squashbusters.org/">SquashBusters</a> from 2017 to 2022, assisting middle and high school students with homework and projects.  I also helped as needed preparing juniors and seniors for the SATs and for college applications.
</li>
<li>
I was a mentor for <a href="https://sites.google.com/nhsau57.org/salemrobotics">FRC 6324</a>, a high school robotics team from Salem, NH, until early 2020.  A proud alumnus, I took the skills I developed as the 2016-17 season student coach to mentor the electrical sub-teams and assist with strategy development.
</li>
</ul>

## Other fun facts
<ul>
<li>
I play the tenor saxophone, and have since junior high school.  In high school, I participated in marching band, jazz ensemble & concert band.  In college, I played in the Northeastern Pep Band (until 2022) & Concert Band (until 2019).
</li>
<li>
I played chess competitively until I realized I didn't have patience for many-hour games (around the end of junior high).  I switched to teaching chess, and started an after-school chess program for elementary school students while I was in high school.  By the time I graduated, I had taught over 400 students, having run programs at five local schools and coordinated several other volunteers.
</li>
<li>
I have a dog <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fZBftfccdg7yFLMK8">Quincy</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/idMGZAWE86AF3bXL7">chickens</a>.
